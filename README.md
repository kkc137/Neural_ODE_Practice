# Neural_ODE_Practice
This repository is for learning Neural ODE and related practice. Come on!!!!!!!

## for the first step: 
1 Choose a DE system eg. $`\frac{dx}{dt}`$ = $`\lambda * x`$, and randomly select the parameters in this system. then we can have a lot of values of (t,x), which is original data of this system.

2 Define ODE system dudt=  .eg.we give $`\lambda`$ a guess value $`\lambda_{0}`$

3 Define Loss function

4 Run K epochs and then estimate the best $`\lambda`$ to make it recover the original $`\lambda`$. 

5 When solve problems above, try more complicated equation systems with more parameters!
